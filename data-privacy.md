This is a non-commercial website. It has been generated for test and educational
purposes only.

This website in itself does not collect user data. It also does not employ
trackers or analysis software such as _google analytics_.

However, this website is built upon the product
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and, thus, is hosted on GitHub.

In this context the data-protection and data privacy mechanisms of GitHub apply.
